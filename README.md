[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/digital-plumbers-union/jkcfg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/digital-plumbers-union/jkcfg)

A pre-1.0 collection of TypeScript packages to use with [jkcfg](https://github.com/jkcfg/jk).

- `apps/` contains modules which are standalone application definitions.  They can be rendered with or without parameters directly to YAML, or included in other TypeScript code used to generate manifests (see https://github.com/booninite/manifests).
- `lib/` contains the utility functions and models used to define apps.
